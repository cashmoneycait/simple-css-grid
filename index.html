          <h3>Something like a phenomenon, baby!</h3>
          <p>
            Tellin' your body to come along, but white lines blow away. Ticket to ride, white line highway. Tell all your friends, that they can go my way. Pay your toll, sell your soul. Pound for pound, costs more than gold. The longer you stay, the more you pay. My white line, go a long way. Either up your nose or through your vein. With nothin' to gain, except killin' your brain. Higher, baby!
          </p>

            Rang dang diggedy dang di-dang. Rang dang diggedy dang di-dang. Rang dang diggedy dang di-dang. Diggedy dang di-dang diggedy dang di-dang.

          <p>
            Pure as driven snow. Connected to my mind and now I'm havin' fun, baby! It's getting kinda low. 'Cause it makes you feel so nice. I need some one-on-one, baby! Don't let it blow your mind away. Baby!And go into your little hideaway.'Cause white lines blow away. A million magic crystals, painted pure and white. A multi-million dollars, almost overnight. Twice as sweet as sugar, twice as bitter as salt. And if you get hooked, baby, it's nobody else's fault, so don't do it! Higher, baby!
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't you get too high baby! You really turn me on and on. My temperature is risin'. No, I don't want you to go. A street kid gets arrested, gonna do some time. He got out three years from now just to commit more crime. A businessman is caught with 24 kilos. He's out on bail and out of jail and that's the way it goes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Athletes rejected, governors corrected. Gangsters, thugs and smugglers are thoroughly respected. The money gets divided. The women get excited. Now I'm broke and it's no joke. It's hard as hell to fight it, don't buy it!
